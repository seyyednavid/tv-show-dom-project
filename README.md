# TV Show DOM Project
Create a Web App to Display TV Show Episode Details


# Goals:
Develop an app that offers users access to a variety of TV series and episodes through API integration. Users can easily browse and select series and episodes, with the added convenience of a live search feature for quick access to their desired content.

# User stories:
1- As a user, I want to browse a list of available TV series so that I can choose one to watch.<br />
2 - As a user, I want to see a list of episodes for the selected series, making it easy to pick the one I want to watch.<br />
3 - As a user, I want the option to perform a live search to quickly find a specific series or episode by entering keywords.<br />
4 - As a user, I want to easily navigate through the app and switch between different series and episodes for a seamless viewing experience.<br />

# Technologies:
Developed a JavaScript-based web app, employing features such as DOM manipulation, Event Listeners, fetch API, async/await, and Bootstrap.
